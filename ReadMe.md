This Terminal was developed and made by [Riyzz]

Really simple and easy to use, Literally made this in my spare time for those [COM-SKIDS] who struggle to load bots and make a good list.

To run the ssh terminal || ./terminal

<--[Features]-->

 - [List-Maker] | Auto List-Maker that makes a very nice and huge list and gets every single ip in the range and every range in the ASN with IPv6 filter to filter out unwanted IPv6 **YOU CAN PUT ANY ASN FOR ANY EXPLOIT OR LOADER YOU HAVE TO MAKE A LIST BTW NOT JUST FOR SSH, OTHER FEATURES IS THO**.

 - [zmap|brute|load] | Auto SSH-Scanner that will auto load to your Net. Remeber SKIDS and SKIDLETS put your payload in the [payload.txt]

 - [AUTO-INSTALLATION] | Auto-Installations for those who do not know who to install dependencies and packages, This will auto install them with the options of installing it either on CentOS or Ubuntu operating systems.

 - [Credits] | This is to ensure people know who made it with the mark [FREE] stamped on it so people do not sell this and scam niggas as they are a typical broke retard thirsty for money, skids will be skids lol.
 
 - [EXIT] | This feature is simply to exit out of the terminal **If you [ctrl c] there will be some running pids from this program running in the background so exit will kill all pids from this program and full exit & close the program.**
 
- [NOTE] | `Everything is compiled to ensure that skids and skidlets do not take my code and skid rip it, Only thing that is not compiled is the loader.py simply cause i just dont give a fuck about it no more. If the program does not run then install this | yum install gcc -y | yum install libcurl-devel -y | apt install gcc -y | apt install curl -y | chmod 777 *`
